# ChildCare
<h3 align="left">Problem Statement :</h3>
<p dir = "auto">
The problem that a parental control application aims to address is the increasing use of technology by children and the potential risks associated with their online activities. Moreover, children may become addicted to technology, which can
lead to negative impacts on their physical and mental health. Parents need a way to manage their children's online activities, restrict access
to inappropriate content, and monitor their behavior to ensure their safety and well-being.
</p>
<h3 align="left">Proposed Solution :</h3>
<p dir = "auto">"Parents whose children are spending a lot of time on their smartphones or tablets should use ChildCare to control their children's screen time or activity. ChildCare makes it easy to set boundaries for your child. You can manage their screen time, discover the installed applications, block addictive applications, locate them in real-time, or set a Geo-fence around them. You can also access their SMS messages, phone calls and view their contacts as well as calling or messaging these contacts."</p>
